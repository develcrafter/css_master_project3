                We can all think of at least one song that, when we hear it,
                triggers an emotional response. It might be a song that accompanied
                the first dance at your wedding, for example, or a song that reminds
                you of a difficult break-up or the loss of a loved one.

                The Paris auction house Tajan will offer a rediscovered drawing by
                Leonardo da Vinci at public sale on June 19, for the first time,
                testing the market for a work by the Renaissance master after the
                extraordinary sale of “Salvator Mundi” last year. The sale will come
                almost 500 years after da Vinci died, in May 1519, at Amboise,
                France.
